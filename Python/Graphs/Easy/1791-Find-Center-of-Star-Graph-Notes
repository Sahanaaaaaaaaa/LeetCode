Example: g = [[1,2],[2,3],[4,2]]

The trick:
In a star graph, the center appears in every edge.
So if you just look at the first two edges, the common node between them is the center.

Step by step:

Check if g[0][0] (first node of first edge) is equal to either node in the second edge (g[1][0] or g[1][1]).

If yes → it’s the center.

Otherwise, the other node in the first edge (g[0][1]) must be the center.
