Basically print alternate 0s and based on if next one is even or odd, release that correspoding lock

PsuedoCode:
initialize zero_lock = free
initialize odd_lock = locked
initialize even_lock = locked

function zero():
    for i from 1 to n:
        acquire zero_lock
        print(0)
        if i is odd:
            release odd_lock
        else:
            release even_lock

function odd():
    for i from 1 to n step 2:
        acquire odd_lock
        print(i)
        release zero_lock

function even():
    for i from 2 to n step 2:
        acquire even_lock
        print(i)
        release zero_lock

Few mistakes made:
- Name conflict → you used self.zero both for the lock and the method.
- Wrong variable in condition → used n+1%2 instead of (i+1) % 2.
- Printing wrong value → printNumber(n) instead of printNumber(i) in even and odd.
- Range off-by-one → used range(…, self.n, …) instead of range(…, self.n+1, …) (last number skipped).
