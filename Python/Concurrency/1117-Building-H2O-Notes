### ðŸ”¹ Goal

* Synchronize threads so that **exactly 2 hydrogen + 1 oxygen** form each water molecule.
* Output: `"HHO"` (order of Hâ€™s and O may vary, but always 2H + 1O together).

---

### ðŸ”¹ Code Idea

```python
self.sem_h = Semaphore(2)     # allow max 2 hydrogens
self.sem_o = Semaphore(1)     # allow max 1 oxygen
self.bar_assembling = Barrier(3)  # wait until 3 threads arrive
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ How Hydrogen Works

```python
with self.sem_h:              # only 2 hydrogens allowed
    self.bar_assembling.wait()  # block until 3 threads ready
    releaseHydrogen()           # print "H"
```

âœ” Prints **once per hydrogen thread** â†’ 2 times per molecule.

---

### ðŸ”¹ How Oxygen Works

```python
with self.sem_o:              # only 1 oxygen allowed
    self.bar_assembling.wait()  # wait for 3 total
    releaseOxygen()             # print "O"
```

âœ” Prints **once per oxygen thread** â†’ 1 time per molecule.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Barrier Role

* Ensures **all 3 (2H + 1O) must reach before printing starts**.
* Once barrier is full (3 threads), they all continue â†’ printing **H, H, O**.
* Then barrier resets for the next molecule.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Key Flow per Molecule

1. Two hydrogen threads acquire `sem_h`.
2. One oxygen thread acquires `sem_o`.
3. All 3 wait at `barrier.wait()`.
4. Barrier releases â†’ each thread calls its print.
5. Together they print `"HHO"`.

âœ… Output example:

```
HHOHHOHHO...
```
