This is the psuedo code:

Initialize empty stack

For each asteroid in asteroids:
    While stack is not empty AND last asteroid in stack is moving right (positive) 
          AND current asteroid is moving left (negative):

        If absolute value of current > top of stack:
            Pop the stack (TOS destroyed)
            Continue checking with new TOS

        Else if absolute value of current == top of stack:
            Pop the stack (both destroyed)
            Stop checking (curr also destroyed)

        Else (top of stack is bigger):
            Stop checking (curr destroyed)

    If no collision happened inside while:
        Push current asteroid to stack

Return stack
